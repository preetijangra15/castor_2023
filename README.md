# Build an FAQ bot for a student-led hackathon

The goal of this project is to build an FAQ bot that provides students with information about a student-led hackathon. The bot will be designed to be interactive and engaging, with a fun and approachable tone. The bot will provide students with information about the event, including the schedule, location, rules, and prizes. The bot will also provide information about the registration process, and will encourage students to register for the hackathon.
